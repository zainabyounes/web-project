      <p>A fashion accessory is a secondary supplementary to a user's clothing which is usually used to complete 
        a garment and completes the look of the user.
        One of the things we notice about fashionable women is not just their clothes which look great, 
        but their clothes are always punctuated with great accessories. 
        There is often a great style in the details.
        Like the fashion itself, the shapes, silhouettes, and colors of the accessories also change over time. 
        In general, it is hard to find cool new looks but a trendy bag or catwalk style necklace
        can be combined with older clothes to create new clothes. Investing on some fun, new,
        fashionable accessories that can update your wardrobe throughout the season even it
        is not in accordance with the current fashion trends.Clothes can create the majority 
        of clothes but accessories are more important than you think. Accessories and clothes are 
        equally important in your outfit, working together to create a harmony that expresses your 
        style and who you are.

    <p>Accessories give more importance to your personal style, taste, and preferences. 
        They also offer unlimited opportunities for clothes, helping you to do the best of each item you have.
        Clothes take up more space physically in your closet and clothes, 
        but accessories are important details to complete each appearance. 
        By itself, a bag, scarf or headband may not have much effect. However, 
        when combined with clothes the accessories help create a robust outfit.
        Accessories are as important as clothing, offering a whole new opportunity to express yourself.
        With accessories, you can create a fluent style waves up from head to toe. We sometimes hear the
         word bagology, which is actually used to define the study of handbags in order to help people 
         understand them better, their purpose, but also the meaning they carry. You might actually 
         find this quite silly, or something no one thinks about; but is that really true? Big fashion 
         companies actually use this in order to create a bag that is most suited for a particular group 
         of people that accommodates their needs, and their fashion style. The same way a backpack can tell 
         that you are a laid-back person, someone who has a casual approach for most things; 
         a briefcase can tell that you are in a hurry, and that you are someone who 
         takes their work quite seriously.Naturally, all this can be used to improve your appearance,
         and you can actually convey the look you want others to perceive simply by adjusting your appearance.
        For girls, a clutch bag can say that she is someone who takes great pride in her looks.
        Messenger bags border between practicality and appearance, and can serve both purposes, 
        depending on what kind of the material you choose, the size and the rest of your clothes.</p>
